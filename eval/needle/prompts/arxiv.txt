ABSTRACT

Stablecoins promise par convertibility, yet issuers must balance immediate liq-
uidity against yield on reserves to keep the peg credible. We study this treasury
problem as a continuous-time control task with two instruments: reallocating re-
serves between cash and short-duration government bills, and setting a spread fee
for either minting or burning the coin. Mint and redemption flows follow mutually
exciting processes that reproduce clustered order flow; peg deviations arise when re-
demptions exceed liquid reserves within settlement windows. We develop a stochas-
tic model predictive control framework that incorporates moment closure for event
intensities. Using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, we demonstrate that the op-
timal control exhibits a bang-off-bang structure: each asset type is purchased at
maximum capacity when the utility difference exceeds the corresponding difference
in shadow costs. Introducing settlement windows leads to a sampled-data imple-
mentation with a simple threshold (soft-thresholding) structure for rebalancing. We
also establish a monotone stress-response property: as expected outflows intensify
or windows lengthen, the optimal policy shifts predictably toward cash. In simula-
tions covering various stress test scenarios, the controller preserves most bill carry
in calm markets, builds cash quickly when stress emerges, and avoids unnecessary
rotations under transitory signals. The proposed policy is implementation-ready and
aligns naturally with operational cut-offs. Our results translate empirical flow risk
into auditable treasury rules that improve peg quality without sacrificing avoidable
carry.

1. Introduction

Stablecoins have become an indispensable component of the infrastructure of crypto-
asset markets and an increasingly relevant settlement rail beyond them. Their defining
promise is par convertibility to a more traditional asset, usually a fiat currency or a
commodity, on demand. Fulfilling that promise requires an issuer to satisfy redemp-
tions promptly while earning sufficient carry on reserves to operate sustainably. Regu-
latory agencies typically restrict issuers to a narrow range of permissible reserve assets.

For example, the recently enacted U.S. GENIUS Act [1] requires that stablecoin is-
suers pegged to the US dollar hold currency reserves exclusively in cash, short-term US
government bonds, or overnight repurchase agreements thereof. In operational terms,
this creates a treasury policy problem: how much of the reserve to hold as immediately
available cash versus short-duration government bills, and how to set mint and burn
spreads that help absorb order-flow imbalances without creating persistent departures
of the secondary-market price from one. This paper develops a continuous-time frame-
work that treats reserve allocation and fee setting as joint controls under stochastic
mint and redemption flows. The objective is to minimize peg deviations and trading
frictions while preserving yield, with policies designed to be implementable within
daily treasury workflows.

While fiat-backed stablecoins operate outside the full decentralization paradigm,
their treasury management problem intersects with broader dynamics in decentral-
ized finance (DeFi). A literature review by [2] identifies stablecoins as a central class
of ”financial tokens” in DeFi, emphasizing that even fully collateralized designs can
deviate from their peg, exhibit state-dependent volatility, and depend critically on liq-
uidity provision and external data feeds. This positioning situates issuer reserve poli-
cies alongside on-chain mechanisms, market microstructure effects, and inter-protocol
linkages that can amplify or dampen peg pressures.

Related market-design research links validator and block-builder incentives to liq-
uidity and price stability in on-chain asset markets. [3] show that block-production
timing strategies can yield measurable gains in maximal extractable value (MEV)
without necessarily harming consensus stability. For pegged digital assets that rely on
on-chain liquidity pools, MEV-maximizing behaviors among market participants can
affect execution quality for redemptions and rebalancing, introducing another stochas-
tic element into to the issuer’s reserve-management problem.

[4] show that well-connected crypto funds can boost token valuation and long-run
performance, suggesting that similar strategic engagement with liquidity providers and
market-makers could strengthen stablecoin reserve-management.

Recent empirical work clarifies why issuers must carefully manage both their mint-
and-burn policies and reserve assets, even for fully collateralized digital currencies. [5]
documents that while the mean cryptocurrency issued in an initial coin offering (ICO)
can deliver positive long-run buy-and-hold returns, the median token loses roughly
30% of its value over one to twenty-four months, with large issuances more often
overpriced and underperforming. [6] use high-frequency data to show that no major
stablecoin is absolutely stable, that return variance is non-zero, and that volatility is
state dependent. Related studies document that stability varies meaningfully across
designs and over time [7, 8], and that some stablecoins can act as conditional diversifiers
or safe havens relative to Bitcoin during stress [9, 10]. These findings imply that
operational choices inside the issuer, such as cash buffers, rebalancing cadence, and
fee schedules, can shape realized peg behavior observed in secondary markets.

Price formation around the peg can be modeled by combining primary arbitrage
with secondary-market order-flow dynamics. [11] formalizes a fully collateralized en-
vironment in which arbitrage against the issuer and trend-following demand inter-
act with deviations from fundamental value. Empirically, peg deviations and trend
variables predict short-horizon returns when extreme observations are retained, while
explanatory power shrinks once large dislocations are trimmed [11]. This pattern is
consistent with frictions and regime-like behavior, and it motivates state-dependent
fee and inventory policies that anticipate clustered dislocations rather than treating
all deviations as transitory noise.

A second body of evidence connects visible stablecoin flows to activity in major
crypto assets. [12] study 1,587 on-chain stablecoin transfers of at least one million U.S.
dollars and find significant abnormal increases in Bitcoin trading volume around these
transfers. High-frequency work on Tether corroborates flow-through to returns and
microstructure [13], and pandemic-period analyses report regime-dependent behav-
ior consistent with liquidity demand and risk rebalancing [14]. These results support
modeling mint and redemption dynamics as first-order drivers of liquidity demand
that issuers must be prepared to meet.

The causal direction between issuance and prices remains debated. [15] present
evidence that Tether flows arrive after downturns and predict positive subsequent
Bitcoin returns; [16] also report issuance-related effects on Bitcoin. In contrast, [17]
finds that issuance largely reacts to crypto price moves, with weak net spillovers from
stablecoins to major crypto assets once contemporaneous correlations are controlled.
Both mechanisms can surface in different market states, which is consistent with a
policy problem in which the issuer prepares for rare but severe clustering of outflows
without sacrificing unnecessary carry in normal conditions.

Macro-financial conditions further shape stablecoin behavior and the reserve allo-
cation trade-off. [18] document that increases in interbank rates compress prices and
volatility of leading stablecoins while raising both price levels and volatility of tradi-
tional cryptocurrencies; trading activity increases across both groups. Beyond market
microstructure, general-equilibrium perspectives suggest that widespread adoption can
carry macroeconomic implications for money and credit [19]. For fiat-backed issuers,
rate regimes move the opportunity cost of holding cash relative to short-duration gov-
ernment bills. When redemption risk is elevated, the opportunity cost of liquidity is
not static; it shifts with the interest-rate environment in ways that directly influence
the optimal cash share.

Connectedness across stablecoins introduces sector-level channels of stress trans-
mission and substitution. [20] propose complementary stability metrics and show that
large USD-backed coins transmit stability conditions to smaller peers. Studies of safe-
haven and hedging properties also reveal state dependence across assets and sectors
[10], with COVID-era work on gold-backed tokens highlighting additional substitution
and spillover channels [21–23]. These insights justify scenario designs in which a few
dominant issuers shape the overall flow environment faced by the sector.

Stress episodes in non-fiat-backed designs provide quantitative benchmarks for op-
erational frictions, capacity constraints, and governance responses. [24] analyze Maker-
DAO around March 2020 and document how congestion concentrated liquidations into
narrow windows and reduced auction effectiveness. The Terra–Luna collapse illustrates
a distinct failure mode. [25] develops a continuous-time account linking burn dynam-
ics and suspension beliefs; [26] assemble a high-frequency timeline of the unwind; and
recent modeling of algorithmic stablecoin volatility complements these post-mortems
[27]. While our scope is fiat-backed issuers operating with high-quality reserves, these
episodes underscore the need for explicit, stress-aware liquidity policy at intra-day
horizons and motivate the inclusion of settlement windows, queueing effects, and fric-
tion costs in our objective.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 (Reserve Management
Framework) introduces the reserve-eligibility set, the regulatory liquidity hierarchy, the
dynamic reserve model with peg dynamics, and the state and control variables used
throughout. Within Section 2, Subsection 2.2 develops the dynamic reserve model that
links flows, liquidity, and peg deviations. Section 3 develops the solution approach, in-
cluding stochastic model predictive control, the Pontryagin conditions that generate

3

feedback policies, and a settlement-window implementation; the sampled-data control
used in practice is detailed in Subsection 3.3. Section 4 specifies scenarios and pa-
rameters, compares the controller with liquidity- and yield-focused benchmarks, and
reports sensitivity analyses. Section 5 concludes.

2. Reserve Management Framework

2.1. Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory authorities worldwide enforce stringent requirements concerning the as-
set classes permissible as collateral for stablecoin issuers. In this paper, we adopt the
U.S. regulatory framework as our primary reference point for modeling purposes. This
approach is motivated by several factors: the maturity and transparency of U.S. finan-
cial regulation, its substantial global influence, and the availability of comprehensive
legislative proposals such as the Genius Act. While our analysis focuses on U.S. reg-
ulations, the resulting models readily generalize to other jurisdictions, as most major
economies have converged on similar regulatory principles for stablecoins—particularly
the requirements for full collateralization through high-quality liquid assets and ro-
bust redemption guarantees. Under the U.S. regulatory framework, Title VII, Section
604(b)(1) of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins
Act of 2025 (the ”GENIUS Act”) delineates six categories of high-quality, liquid assets
eligible to serve as collateral for payment stablecoins on a strict 1:1 basis [1]:

(1) U.S. currency and balances held directly at a Federal Reserve Bank
(2) Demand deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions; that is,
checking or transaction accounts held at commercial banks, insured by the U.S.
government against default.

(3) U.S. Treasury securities with residual maturity ≤ 90 days; that is, short-

term federal debt instruments.

(4) Overnight reverse-repo agreements backed by Treasuries, cleared tri-
party or with a highly credit-worthy counterparty; i.e., short-term lending
arrangements where the issuer temporarily exchanges cash for Treasury collat-
eral, typically settled via a clearing bank.

(5) Government-only money-market fund shares invested solely in as-
sets (1)–(4); that is, pooled investment vehicles offering liquidity and diver-
sification while limiting holdings to ultra-safe, short-term instruments.

(6) Tokenised forms of any asset in (1)–(5), excluding repo contracts;
that is, cryptographic representations of reserve assets issued on a blockchain,
provided the underlying remains fully redeemable and auditable.

These six categories establish a natural liquidity hierarchy that reflects different
settlement windows and operational characteristics. At the apex of this hierarchy
are cash balances and Federal Reserve master accounts, which provide instantaneous
settlement capability but generate no yield, creating an inflation drag on reserves while
offering complete elimination of market risk. Shortterm U.S. Treasury securities with
maturities of 90 days or less generally settle within standard banking hours, providing
substantially higher yields that currently approximate 5.4% p.a. while maintaining
deep market liquidity and qualifying as Level-1 High Quality Liquid Assets under Basel
III regulations. However, these instruments introduce duration risk and potential fire-
sale losses during periods of intense redemption pressure. The remaining asset classes

4

exhibit varying combinations of liquidity constraints and settlement windows that
create a graduated spectrum of operational flexibility. FDIC-insured demand deposits
typically process during Fedwire operating windows, while government money market
fund shares offer same-day liquidity under normal market conditions but may impose
restrictions during periods of market stress. Tokenized representations of these assets
provide 24/7 trading capability through blockchain networks, though final settlement
of the wrapped asset remains constrained by the operational windows of the native
market.

The fundamental trade-off between cash and Treasury securities illustrates the cen-
tral tension in stablecoin reserve management. Cash holdings maximize liquidity and
eliminate market risk but impose opportunity costs through foregone interest income,
particularly pronounced in rising rate environments. Treasury securities offer attractive
risk-adjusted returns and maintain high liquidity under normal conditions but intro-
duce duration risk and volatility during market dislocations. The other permitted asset
classes present similar risk-return considerations, each with specific additional com-
plexities such as smart contract and legal title risks introduced by tokenized wrappers.
Throughout our analysis, we adopt benchmark parameters that reflect current mar-
ket conditions, with the risk-free cash rate set at zero as vault cash earns no interest,
while three-month Treasury securities yield approximately 5.4% p.a. based on prevail-
ing yield curves.1

2.2. A Dynamic Reserve Model

2.2.1. Demand And Peg Stability
The peg deviation ∆P (t) ∈ R measures the stablecoin’s price displacement from its
$1 target, where ∆P (t) > 0 indicates the coin trades below par. We model the sta-
blecoin’s mint and redemption dynamics as self-exciting processes that capture the
empirical tendency for large transactions to cluster in time, while the peg deviation
evolves deterministically based on liquidity shortfalls. Let NR(t) and NM (t) denote
the cumulative redemption and mint counts up to time t, each following a univariate
Hawkes process with stochastic intensities

λR(t) = λ0,R +

(cid:90) t

κRe−θR(t−s)dNR(s) + ζ∆P (t),

λM (t) = λ0,M +

(cid:90) t

κM e−θM (t−s)dNM (s),

where λ0,R, λ0,M ≥ 0 are baseline intensities, κR, κM > 0 capture self-excitation (each
event increases the likelihood of subsequent events), and θR, θM > 0 govern the ex-
ponential decay of this excitation. The redemption intensity includes an additional
feedback term ζ∆P (t)2 with ζ ≥ 0, reflecting how peg instability accelerates re-
demptions. This mechanism endogenously models bank-run dynamics characterized
by self-reinforcing distrust in the currency’s stability.

Let M (t) and R(t) denote cumulative dollar volumes of mints and redemptions,
with instantaneous net redemption flow Q(t) = ˙R(t) − ˙M (t). These dollar flows arise

where marks z represent individual transaction sizes with finite first moments.

− γδ(t),

(4)

where Rliq(t) denotes immediately available cash reserves, Sout(t) = Sout(0) + M (t) −
R(t) is the outstanding supply, and δ(t) represents the mint/burn fee spread. The de-
viations resulting from equation (4) directly reflect deficits in reserve coverage, rather
than being mitigated by supply and demand. The first term captures how liquidity
shortfalls—when redemption requests Q(t) exceed available cash Rliq(t)—create peg
pressure proportional to the fraction of supply that cannot be serviced. The param-
eter η > 0 governs this sensitivity, while γ > 0 determines how effectively fees can
counteract peg deviations. This deterministic relationship makes peg stability an op-
erational challenge: maintaining ∆P (t) ≈ 0 requires either sufficient liquidity buffers
or appropriate fee policies to offset redemption pressure.

2.2.2. Reserve-Balance State Model

In the remaining text, we make the simplifying assumption that the coin issuer em-
ploys only vault cash (categories 1-2 from subsection 2.1) and short-dated Treasury
securities (category 3) as reserve assets. This simplification is due to the fact that the
remaining permitted asset types primarily represent overnight carries or swaps of these
two base assets, serving as operational vehicles rather than fundamentally distinct re-
serve instruments. The stablecoin issuer’s operational challenge involves dynamically
allocating reserves between immediately available cash and yield-bearing Treasury se-
curities while maintaining peg stability. We formalize this as a control problem with
state vector

(5)

where Rliq(t) represents immediately available cash reserves, Rbill(t) denotes the face
value of short-dated Treasury securities, ∆P (t), and λR(t), λM (t) are the Hawkes
intensities governing redemption and mint clustering. The controller manages this
system through

u(t) =

(cid:21)

(cid:20)ω(t)
δ(t)

∈ [−ωmax, ωmax] × [−δmax, δmax],

(6)

where ω(t) represents the reallocation flow between cash and bills (positive for cash-
to-bills, negative for bills-to-cash), and δ(t) is the mint/burn fee spread.

The reserve balances evolve according to

dRliq(t) = rcashRliq(t)dt − Q(t)dt − ω(t)dt,

dRbill(t) = rbill(t)Rbill(t)dt + ω(t)dt.

(7)

(8)

For tractability within control horizons [tk, tk+1], we treat the T-bill rate as piecewise
constant: rbill(t) ≡ r(k)
bill for t ∈ [tk, tk+1]. Our baseline assumes rcash = 0, reflecting
that vault cash and Federal Reserve master account balances earn no interest, though
the framework accommodates rcash ̸= 0 without structural changes.

The state constraints Rliq(t) ≥ 0 and Rbill(t) ≥ 0, combined with the bounded
reallocation rate |ω(t)| ≤ ωmax, endogenize the fundamental liquidity-yield trade-off:
higher Treasury allocations increase returns but reduce the buffer against redemption
surges, potentially triggering peg instability through the mechanism in equation (4).
The balance sheet identity Rliq(t) + Rbill(t) = Sout(t) (up to small operational items)
ensures conservation of reserves relative to outstanding supply.

2.2.3. Optimal Control Problem

The stablecoin issuer seeks to maximize yield while maintaining peg stability and
operational efficiency. We formalize this through a cost functional that captures the
competing objectives of interest generation, peg quality, user experience, and opera-
tional frictions. The instantaneous cost is

ℓ(cid:0)x(t), u(t)(cid:1) = cpeg ∆P (t)2 + cfee δ(t)2 + λω |ω(t)| +

where the terms represent: (i) peg stability penalty cpeg∆P (t)2 monetizing reputa-

aging excessive mint/burn spreads that degrade user experience; (iii) reallocation cost
λω |ω(t)| + 1
2 ρω ω(t)2 capturing operational frictions and market impact from portfolio
adjustments; and (iv) interest benefit −r(k)
billRbill(t) representing carry from Treasury
holdings. The quadratic penalties ensure convexity while the linear yield term creates
the fundamental tension between liquidity provision and return generation.

The infinite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem is to select an admissible

where the net redemption flow Q(t) = ˙R(t) − ˙M (t) arises from marked Hawkes pro-

Admissible controls must satisfy the operational constraints (6), be progres-
sively measurable with respect to the filtration {Ft}, and maintain state feasibility
Rliq(t), Rbill(t) ≥ 0.

The infinite-horizon problem faces well-posedness challenges from cost integral
convergence despite potentially unbounded Treasury growth, the non-smooth term
[Q(t) − Rliq(t)]+ in peg dynamics, and potentially explosive paths from the peg-
redemption feedback loop. The following standard conditions ensure well-posedness:
(i) positive discount rate ρ > 0 with bounded interest rates; (ii) subcritical Hawkes
processes satisfying κR/θR < 1 and κM /θM < 1 ensuring stationary intensities; (iii)
bounded controls maintaining nonnegative reserves; and (iv) the balance sheet con-
straint preventing unbounded carry extraction.

3. Analytical and Computational Methods

3.1. Stochastic Model Predictive Control

The infinite-horizon optimal control problem formulated above presents significant
computational challenges for real-time implementation. This motivates our adoption
of Model Predictive Control (MPC), a rolling optimization strategy that approximates
the infinite-horizon solution through repeated finite-period problems. Model Predictive
Control implements the following strategy: at each decision time tk, we solve a finite-
horizon optimal control problem using the current state and forecasts of future un-
certainty. Only the initial portion of the computed optimal trajectory is implemented
before re-solving at the next decision point tk+1 with updated information. This ap-
proach naturally handles constraints while incorporating predictions of future system
behavior. For stablecoin reserve management, MPC offers several key advantages: it
requires no prior training data, making it immediately applicable without extensive
historical datasets; it produces transparent and auditable policies through explicit
optimization of well-defined objectives, ensuring regulatory compliance; it naturally
incorporates forward-looking capability to anticipate redemption clusters and settle-
ment windows; and it effectively handles high-dimensional continuous state spaces and
hybrid jump dynamics through direct optimization.

At each roll time tk, we solve the finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem

subject to the system dynamics and admissibility constraints. The filtration Ftk rep-
resents all information available at time tk, including the complete history of mint and
redemption events, current reserve levels, and realized peg deviations. As a measure-
theoretic object, Ftk is the σ-algebra generated by all observable processes up to time
tk, ensuring that our control decisions are non-anticipating—they depend only on past
and present information, not future realizations.

Our stochastic MPC framework reduces the stochastic optimization problem to
a deterministic equivalent through moment-based approximation of the underlying
stochastic processes. Rather than propagating full probability distributions or sam-
pling scenarios, we replace all random quantities by their conditional expectations
given Ftk. This transformation occurs at two levels. First, between MPC rolls, we
maintain filtered estimates of the Hawkes intensities using the recursive updates

λX (t+) = λX (t−) + κX

λX (t + ∆)− = λ0,X + (cid:0)λX (t+) − λ0,X

(cid:1)e−θX ∆

(17)

(18)

for X ∈ {R, M }. These updates are deterministic given the observed event stream,
providing initial conditions λR(t+

k ) for the planning phase.

k ) and λM (t+

Within the optimization horizon [tk, tk + T ], we must propagate conditional mean
intensities to compute the expected redemption flow ˆQ(t) at each instant. Simply using
initial intensities would ignore the predictable evolution of redemption pressure over
the planning horizon. The conditional mean intensities evolve according to

˙ˆλR(t) = −θR(ˆλR(t) − λ0,R) + κR
˙ˆλM (t) = −θM (ˆλM (t) − λ0,M ) + κM

ˆλR(t) + ζ∆P (t)2,

ˆλR(tk) = λR(t+

k ),

ˆλM (t),

ˆλM (tk) = λM (t+

k ),

(19)

(20)

ˆλX (t) arise from taking expectations of future jump
where the self-excitation terms κX
contributions. These ODEs exploit the Markovian property of exponential Hawkes
processes: given current intensities, the expected future evolution depends only on
ˆλR(t) −
these values, not the full history. The expected net redemption flow ˆQ(t) = ¯zR
ˆλM (t) then enters the deterministic system dynamics, with the crucial feedback
¯zM
that peg deviations influence future redemption intensity through the ζ∆P (t)2 term.
This coupling necessitates joint propagation of all state variables, as flows and peg
trajectory depend on each other dynamically. Given mean transaction sizes ¯zR and ¯zM ,
ˆλM (t). Substituting
the expected net redemption flow becomes ˆQ(t) = ¯zR
these deterministic forecasts into the system dynamics yields

ˆλR(t) − ¯zM

where ˆSout(t) evolves according to the expected mint and redemption flows. The com-
puted trajectory u∗(t) for t ∈ [tk, tk + T ] represents the optimal response to expected
future conditions, with only the initial segment u∗(t) for t ∈ [tk, tk+1) implemented
before re-solving with updated state information.

3.2. Event-Triggered Optimization via Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle

Within each MPC roll, we solve the deterministic surrogate problem obtained by
replacing stochastic flows with their conditional expectations. The state vector x =
(Rliq, Rbill, ∆P )⊤ evolves according to the moment-closed dynamics from Section 3.1,
while the Hawkes intensities ˆλR, ˆλM enter as exogenous trajectories.

We seek an optimal control trajectory u(·) from a suitable function space, such as
the Banach space of square-integrable functions L2([0, T ], Rm), rather than a finite-
dimensional vector. This makes the optimization problem infinite-dimensional. To
solve the optimal control problem, Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) trans-
forms the dynamic optimization into a system of differential equations. The optimal
control at each instant must minimize the current-value Hamiltonian

H = ℓ(x, u) + p⊤f (x, u, t),

(24)

which captures the total instantaneous cost: the direct running cost ℓ(x, u) plus the
marginal effect of the control on future costs through its impact on state evolution
f (x, u, t). The optimal control thus balances immediate costs against future conse-
quences. The costates p = (pliq, pbill, p∆P )⊤ can consequently be interpreted as shadow
prices or marginal values of the state variables, measuring how a unit change in each
state affects the total objective value going forward.

Following Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle for infinite-horizon problems, the opti-

mal trajectory must satisfy the following canonical equations:

˙x∗ = f (x∗, u∗, t),
˙p = ρp − ∇xH(x∗, u∗, p, t),

x∗(0) = x0,

u∗(t) ∈ arg min
u∈U

H(x∗(t), u, p(t), t),

(25)
(26)
(27)

where the first term in (26) reflects the accumulation of shadow costs at the discount
rate, while the second term accounts for their depletion as costs are realized over the
infinitesimal interval [t, t+dt]. The transversality condition limt→∞ e−ρtp⊤(t)x∗(t) = 0
ensures that the discounted value of the terminal state vanishes, preventing unbounded
growth of the state-costate product. Since our cost functional is convex in controls and
the reserve dynamics are affine, these necessary conditions from PMP are also sufficient
for optimality, guaranteeing that any solution to this system is globally optimal.

The costate dynamics yield explicit expressions for the shadow prices. For the

This implies that the optimal portfolio reallocation control ω at time t follows a thresh-

action cost (|Sω(t)| ≤ λω), no reallocation within the reserve asset portfolio occurs
(ω∗(t) = 0). If the marginal benefit exceeds the transaction cost (|Sω(t)| > λω), real-
location is performed at the maximal admissible rate (ω∗(t) ∈ {−ωmax, ωmax}).

3.3. Implementation with Settlement Windows

3.3.1. A Discretized Optimal Control Policy

The continuous-time event-triggered policy, while theoretically elegant, requires po-
tential control updates at every mint or redemption event—impractical given typical

11

transaction volumes. We therefore develop a sampled-data formulation that aligns with
operational realities and provides computational tractability.

Let 0 = τ0 < τ1 < τ2 < · · · denote predetermined settlement or review times (e.g.,
Fedwire windows, hourly desk reviews) with intervals ∆j = τj+1 − τj. We constrain
controls to be piecewise constant over these windows:

ω(t) ≡ ωj,

δ(t) ≡ δj

for t ∈ [τj, τj+1).

(37)

This restriction reflects a real operational constraint, as treasury trades typically ex-
ecute in batches at settlement windows, and defines the admissible control set Usd.

Within this framework, the Hamiltonian contribution from reallocation over window

j becomes

Define

(39)

which represents the accumulated relative value of bills versus cash over the window.

subject to ωj ∈ [−ωmax, ωmax]. Since ωj is constant over [τj, τj+1), we can factor it out:

2 ρω∆jω2

j − Sjωj,

(43)

where Sj = (cid:82) τj+1

τj

(pbill(t) − pliq(t))dt as defined in (39).

First consider the unconstrained problem. The objective is convex (sum of convex

functions), and strictly convex when ρω > 0 since the Hessian ∇2Jj = ρω∆j > 0.

For optimality, we require 0 ∈ ∂Jj(ωj), where ∂ denotes the subdifferential. Com-

puting term by term:

• ∂ωj [ 1
2 ρω∆jω2
• ∂ωj [−Sjωj] = −Sj

j ] = ρω∆jωj

12

• ∂ωj [λω∆j|ωj|] = λω∆j · ∂|ωj|

For the absolute value subdifferential at point ωj:

∂|ωj| =






{1}
{−1}
[−1, 1]

if ωj > 0
if ωj < 0
if ωj = 0

Therefore, the optimality condition 0 ∈ ∂Jj(ωj) becomes:

0 ∈ λω∆j · ∂|ωj| + ρω∆jωj − Sj.

We analyze three cases:
Case 1: ωj > 0. Then ∂|ωj| = {1}, so:

0 = λω∆j + ρω∆jωj − Sj =⇒ ωj =

Sj − λω∆j
ρω∆j

.

This is valid only if ωj > 0, i.e., when Sj > λω∆j.

Case 2: ωj < 0. Then ∂|ωj| = {−1}, so:

0 = −λω∆j + ρω∆jωj − Sj =⇒ ωj =

Sj + λω∆j
ρω∆j

.

This is valid only if ωj < 0, i.e., when Sj < −λω∆j.
Case 3: ωj = 0. Then ∂|ωj| = [−1, 1], so we need:

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

0 ∈ λω∆j[−1, 1] + 0 − Sj = [−λω∆j − Sj, λω∆j − Sj].

(48)

This holds if and only if −λω∆j ≤ Sj ≤ λω∆j, i.e., |Sj| ≤ λω∆j.

Combining all cases, the unconstrained optimizer is:

ωunc

j =

Sj−λω∆j
ρω∆j



0

Sj+λω∆j
ρω∆j

if Sj > λω∆j
if |Sj| ≤ λω∆j
if Sj < −λω∆j

This can be written compactly using the soft-thresholding operator:

j = −

shrink(Sj, λω∆j),

(49)

(50)

where shrink(z, λ) := sign(z) max{|z| − λ, 0}.

The constraint set [−ωmax, ωmax] is closed and convex. Since Jj is strictly convex,

the constrained minimizer is unique and given by the Euclidean projection:

j = Proj[−ωmax,ωmax](ωunc

This result preserves the essential structure of the continuous-time solution while
offering practical advantages. Control decisions require only time-averaged costates
Sj and ¯p∆P,j, computed once per settlement window rather than at each transaction,
reducing computational complexity from potentially thousands of transactions to typ-
ically 6-24 daily windows. The policy naturally aligns with institutional constraints
by executing treasury transactions at predetermined windows matching market infras-
tructure like Fedwire hours and repo settlement times, while the averaged switching
function Sj smooths intra-window flow volatility to prevent overreaction to temporary
imbalances. The decision rule admits a transparent interpretation: rebalance at each
window if the averaged value differential exceeds the transaction cost threshold λω∆j,
otherwise maintain positions. Moreover, the effective inaction threshold automatically
adapts to operating conditions, scaling with window length to allow more aggressive
rebalancing over longer intervals where costs amortize better, while becoming more
conservative during stress periods with frequent reviews.

3.3.2. Monotone Stress-Response Behavior

In this section, we analyze how the window-based optimal control responds to vary-
ing levels of redemption pressure. The system favors yield-bearing Treasury holdings
during calm periods and shifts toward cash as redemption demand intensifies. The
following theorem establishes this behavior through analysis of the costate dynamics:

Theorem 3.2 (Monotone Stress-Threshold Principle). Consider the window-based
optimal control (40) over interval [τj, τj+1). Let ˆQ(1) and ˆQ(2) be two forecast paths
with ˆQ(1)(t) ≥ ˆQ(2)(t) for all t ∈ [τj, τj+1). Then:
(1) The optimal reallocation satisfies ω∗
(2) For any parametric family ˆQα(t) = αq(t) with q(t) ≥ 0, there exists a threshold

j ( ˆQ(1)) ≤ ω∗

j ( ˆQ(2))

α∗ ≥ 0 such that:

j ( ˆQα) =
ω∗

(cid:40)
0
∈ {−ωmax, 0, +ωmax}

if α ≤ α∗
if α > α∗

(52)

(3) As α → ∞, ω∗

j ( ˆQα) → −ωmax (maximum cash building)

Proof. We establish monotonicity through a sequence of comparison results on the
state-costate system.

Step 1: State monotonicity. Under fixed controls (ωj, δj) and identical initial

conditions, the state dynamics yield:

d

[R(1)

liq − R(2)

liq ] = −[ ˆQ(1) − ˆQ(2)] ≤ 0,

(53)

implying R(1)
For the peg deviation, since [·]+ is monotone increasing and ˆQ(1) − R(1)

liq (t) for all t ∈ [τj, τj+1).

liq (t) ≤ R(2)

(54)

yielding ∆P (1)(t) ≥ ∆P (2)(t).

Step 2: Costate monotonicity. Working backwards from terminal conditions at

τj+1, the variation of constants formula for the peg costate gives:

p∆P (t) = eρ(t−τj+1)p∆P (τj+1) − 2cpeg

(cid:90) τj+1

t

eρ(t−s)∆P (s) ds.

(55)

Since ∆P (1) ≥ ∆P (2), we have p(1)

∆P (t) ≤ p(2)

∆P (t).

For the liquidity costate, the dynamics

˙pliq = (ρ − rcash)pliq + η

1{ ˆQ>Rliq}
ˆSout

p∆P

(56)

form a linear system with monotone coefficient (the indicator function) and monotone
forcing (since p(1)

∆P ≤ p(2)

∆P ).Hence,

and, consequently,

liq (t) ≤ ˙p(2)
˙p(1)

liq (t)

for all t,

liq (t) ≤ p(2)
p(1)

liq (t)

for all t.

The bill costate evolution is independent of ˆQ, so p(1)
Step 3: Switching function monotonicity. The averaged switching function

bill = p(2)

satisfies:

Sj( ˆQ(1)) − Sj( ˆQ(2)) =

(cid:90) τj+1

τj

liq (t) − p(1)
[p(2)

liq (t)] dt ≥ 0.

(57)

From (40), the optimal control is:

ω∗

j = Proj[−ωmax,ωmax]

(cid:18)

−

1
ρω∆j

shrink(Sj, λω∆j)

.

(58)

(cid:19)

Since z (cid:55)→ −shrink(z, λ) is monotone decreasing and projection preserves monotonic-
ity, larger Sj yields smaller (more negative) ω∗
j .

For the parametric family ˆQα = αq, since Sj( ˆQα) is continuous in the forecast path
ˆQα(t), it is also continuous in α for ˆQα(t) = αq(t). The threshold structure of the
shrinkage operator then guarantees existence of α∗ where the control switches from
inaction to action.

This theorem provides rigorous justification for a simple operational rule:

• Normal markets (low α): The optimal policy maintains treasury positions to

capture yield

• Stress onset (α ≈ α∗): The system reaches a tipping point where liquidity

concerns dominate yield considerations

• Crisis mode (high α): The policy aggressively builds cash reserves at maximum

feasible rate

15

The monotonicity property ensures this transition is predictable and one-directional
as stress intensifies, preventing rapid switching that could amplify market disruption
and erode confidence. This result provides a mathematical formalization of prudent
reserve management: Stable markets allow for large positions in interest-bearing T-
bonds. With increasing volatility, a significant shift to cash is necessary before sell-offs
become self-reinforcing.

4. Numerical Results

In this section, we use simulations of diverse market phenomena to demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of the proposed control algorithm considering both profitability and safety.

4.1. Experimental Design

We conduct numerical experiments over 92 calendar days (August 1 - October 31, 2025)
with three daily settlement windows at 10:00, 13:00, and 16:00 ET, aligning with ma-
jor settlement times. The performance of various control strategies is evaluated using
three scenarios that capture characteristic market stress patterns empirically observed
in financial markets. The construction of these scenarios enables precise testing of our
central hypothesis that the developed control algorithm fulfills three essential require-
ments: first, the exploitation of lucrative investment opportunities in Treasury Bills
during calm market phases; second, the maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves in
volatile phases with potentially endogenous bank-run dynamics; and third, the early
detection of emerging volatility phases, such that proactive liquidity procurement is
initiated at early signs of a demand shock. To systematically investigate these prop-
erties, we define the following market scenarios:

(1) Single shock event: The system operates under baseline conditions for days
0-30, experiences elevated redemption pressure during days 30-45 with baseline
intensity λ0,R multiplied by a factor χ ∼ Uniform[2, 4], then undergoes exponen-
tial mean-reversion with a 10-day time constant through day 92. This stress test
examines the controller’s ability to respond decisively to sustained redemption
pressure and subsequently restore normalized operations.

(2) Prolonged clustering: The system maintains baseline parameters until day 30.
From days 30-70, we increase the self-excitation parameter κR equally for both
mint and redemption requests to bring the branching ratio κR/θR to 0.85, ap-
proaching criticality. This near-critical regime generates persistent ”aftershock”
bursts in mints and redemptions that emerge despite normal baseline intensities.
After day 70, parameters return to baseline.

(3) False alarm (whipsaw): A brief mint surge occurs during days 30-32 where
λ0,M triples, followed by a modest redemption increase to 1.5 × λ0,R during days
32-35, then returning to baseline. This pattern tests whether the controller avoids
unnecessary cash accumulation in response to transient imbalances.

Peg stability is measured by the failure probability, defined as the relative frequency
of complete depeg events (∆P = 1),. Responsiveness is measured by the time lag
between a shock onset and the controller’s increase in cash-buying speed.

In addition to the optimal control described in Subsection 3.3, we evaluate the

performance of two reference strategies:

16

(1) The maximum yield strategy: Maximizes Treasury Bond holdings and con-
verts these to cash exclusively when immediately necessary to cover redemption
requests.

(2) The maximum liquidity strategy: Maintains the entire portfolio exclusively

in liquid assets.

4.2. Parameter Estimation

The interest rates used in our numerical computations are taken from current yield
curves and Federal Reserve projections, expressed on a per-settlement-window basis
(8 hours):

• 90-day Treasury rate: rbill = 0.054/(3 × 365) ≈ 4.93 × 10−5 per window (5.4%

annualized yield as of August 2025)

• Discount rate: ρ = 0.08/(3 × 365) ≈ 7.31 × 10−5 per window (8% annualized cost

of capital reflecting regulatory risk premium)

• Discount rate: ρ = 0.08 × 3/8760 ≈ 2.74 × 10−5 per window (8% annualized cost

of capital reflecting regulatory risk premium)

The following operational parameters are calibrated to approximate those commonly

found in industry practices and settlement infrastructure:

• Maximum reallocation rate: ωmax = 0.1 × Sout per window (10% of supply)
• Settlement windows: ∆j = 8 hours (three windows per day)

To simplify the interpretation of numerical results, we assume zero mint or redemp-
tion fee (δ = 0). For modelling the Hawkes processes, we choose parameters to mimic
the dynamics observed in major stablecoins (USDC, USDT) during 2024-2025. For
baseline intensities, we set λ0,R = 100 events/hour for redemptions and λ0,M = 80
events/hour for mints, corresponding to daily baseline volumes of 2,400 and 1,920
events respectively, which align with typical median volumes for these assets.

To capture the clustering behavior characteristic of stablecoin transactions, we pa-
rameterize the self-excitation dynamics with decay rates of θR = 2.0 hour−1 and
θM = 1.5 hour−1, yielding half-lives of approximately 20-30 minutes that reflect how
quickly bursts of activity dissipate. We set the corresponding jump sizes to κR = 0.8
and κM = 0.6, which ensure subcritical branching ratios (κR/θR = 0.4 < 1 and
κM /θM = 0.4 < 1) necessary for process stability. Finally, transaction sizes follow
exponential distributions with mean redemption size ¯zR = $250, 000 and mean mint
size ¯zM = $300, 000, values representative of institutional trading volumes in these
markets.

The cost function parameters are derived from economic fundamentals and regula-
tory objectives. For peg stability, we assume that deviations from the dollar peg create
arbitrage opportunities proportional to (∆P )2. To maintain deviations below 10 basis
points under normal conditions, we calibrate the peg stability cost as:

cpeg =

Daily carry value
Tolerance2

=

rbill × Sout/365
(0.001)2

≈ 1.5 × 108

(59)

This ensures that the controller’s prioritization of peg maintenance is commensurate
with the economic value at stake. The fee penalty parameter balances user experience

17

with revenue requirements, calibrated to target fees around 10 basis points:

cfee =

Median daily redemption value
(Target fee)2

=

λ0,R × ¯zR × 24
(0.01)2

≈ 6 × 108

(60)

Trading costs reflect Treasury market microstructure, with a linear component λω =
0.0001 × Sout representing the 1 basis point bid-ask spread and a quadratic component
ρω = 0.00001 × Sout capturing price impact for large trades. The peg dynamics are
parameterized based on historical stablecoin de-pegging events: we set the supply-peg
sensitivity η = 10, calibrated so that a 10% supply shortfall creates a 1% peg deviation;
the fee effectiveness parameter γ = 5, whereby a 50 basis point fee counters a 10 basis
point deviation; and the peg feedback strength ζ = 100, such that a 1% deviation
doubles redemption intensity.

For initial conditions, we consider a system at scale with outstanding supply
Sout(0) = $10 billion and zero deviation from the peg (∆P (0) = 0). Transaction
intensities begin at baseline levels: λR(0) = λ0,R and λM (0) = λ0,M . The reserve
allocation strategies differ between controllers: both the optimal controller and the
maximum yield controller begin with Rliq(0) = $1 billion (10%) in liquid assets and
Rbill(0) = $9 billion (90%) in Treasury bills, while the maximum liquidity controller
starts with all reserves ($10 billion) allocated to liquid cash.

4.3. Presentation Of Results

Revenue is calculated as the negative of the cost functional. Table 1 shows the total
revenue by scenario and control strategy. Table 2 displays the fallout rates and re-
sponsiveness measures. We simulated 100 scenarios and report average values for all
metrics, except for the fallout rate, which is shown as a relative frequency. Figure 1

Figure 1. Control actions under different scenarios. The y-axis is scaled in millions dollar per hour. The opti-
mal control is color-coded in green, the maximum-yield strategy in gray, and the maximum-liquidity strategy in
blue. The maximum-liquidity strategy initially shifts massively into T-bonds but must later sell these positions
to meet redemption requests. The optimal control strategy behaves cautiously at first and increases its T-bond
investments only after the stress period. The maximum-yield strategy, by definition, makes no reallocations.

20

The simulation results demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed con-
trol strategy over both myopic yield maximization (maximum yield strategy) and
the conservative cash-only strategy. The maximum yield strategy proves to be clearly
inferior: this approach leads to excessive initial bond purchases across all simulated
scenarios, and systematically confronts the issuer with high redemption obligations
and associated capitalization problems toward the end of the simulation period. Con-
sequently, this strategy exhibits clear underperformance compared to the optimized
control both in terms of generated revenue and default rates. The responsiveness of
this strategy exceeds that of the the proposed approach, as the maximum yield con-
troller usually already experiences liquidity constraints at the time of shock onset and
consequently must react more promptly to increased redemption requests. The advan-
tages of our method over the maximum liquidity strategy are more moderate. However,
particularly during the more stable market phase at the end of the simulation period,
it becomes evident that larger-volume bond purchases are justifiable. Through this
strategic orientation, the optimized controller achieves a significant financial advan-
tage over the conservative strategy.

5. Conclusion

This paper develops an operations-first framework for managing the reserves of a
pegged digital currency, accounting for clustering dynamics in order and redemption
flows and an endogenous dynamical relationship between peg deviation and redemp-
tion intensities. We represent mints and redemptions as self-exciting point processes
and treat peg behavior as an explicit operational outcome by directly linking price
deviations to cash shortfalls within specified time windows. The coin issuer’s control
mechanisms comprise two key instruments: the reallocation rate between immediately
available cash and short-duration government bills, and the spread applied to mint or
burn requests.

Methodologically, the control architecture combines stochastic model predictive con-
trol with a moment-closure forecast for Hawkes intensities and first-order conditions
from Pontryagin’s maximum principle. This yields interpretable shadow prices for
cash, bills, and peg deviation, and in turn produces implementable feedback rules. A
settlement-window formulation converts the continuous problem into a sampled-data
problem that matches wire cut-offs and repo calendars. In the discretized problem for-
mulation, the rebalancing decision takes a soft-thresholding form driven by window-
averaged costates, which provides a clear and auditable switching logic for treasury
desks. We also establish a monotone stress-response property: as expected redemption
pressure increases, as average ticket sizes grow, or as windows lengthen, the optimal
policy tilts predictably toward cash. Conversely, the proposed algorithm enables effi-
cient reallocation into higher-yielding government bonds during calm market phases,
if time windows for reallocation decisions are chosen to be appropriately small.

The numerical experiments show how these design choices translate into outcomes
that matter for issuers. Relative to a maximum-yield benchmark that waits until the
last moment to raise liquidity, and a maximum-liquidity benchmark that forgoes carry,
the window-based controller preserves most of the bill yield in calm conditions while
moving earlier and more decisively when redemption risk rises. Because the policy
depends only on filtered intensities, outstanding supply, and window-averaged shadow
values, it fits daily treasury workflows and supports supervisory review. More broadly,
the framework connects balance-sheet choices to market observables in a way that is

21

transparent: peg deviations emerge only when cash on hand is insufficient within a
window, and the controller’s reallocation speed and fee choices directly manage that
risk.

A critical risk management concern is the tail probability of a complete depeg.
Since such an event is close to catastrophic for the issuer, its probability warrants
careful measurement even when it is very small. In this article we simulated 100 runs,
which provides only limited estimation precision of probabilities below the one percent
level. Future analyses can tighten this by running much larger simulation batches on
specialized hardware, by applying dedicated rare-event techniques, or by developing
analytical tail approximations.

Several extensions, both in terms of theoretical modeling and empirical validation,
would deepen applicability of the proposed approach. Richer flow models with state-
dependent trade sizes and cross-asset excitation, online estimation for time-varying
branching ratios, robust or risk-sensitive MPC variants, and historical backtests with
issuer data would allow closer alignment with specific mandates and regulatory con-
straints. Taken together, the contributions here provide a settlement-aware, inter-
pretable, and auditable control system that turns reserve management into a disci-
plined optimization problem and offers a practical blueprint for resilient peg mainte-
nance.
